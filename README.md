Apache, MySQL, PHP, SQL Challenges...

Selecting from multiple tables.
With small results we could get away with selecting one table at a time.
On the other hand with big data, that would make our programming long and tedious task.
We can join multiple tables and use a select statement...

Cool...Awesome :-)
We use the Computer Lab Experiments...
Steps by steps... two tables at a time...

```
git clone https://github.com/bm33m/newsboxapp.git

Finally: ./treehouse/db/reports.sql have all the queries.
./treehouse/index.php has all the info...
```

Enjoy.
